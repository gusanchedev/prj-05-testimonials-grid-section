## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use CSS nth-of-type:
```css
.card:nth-of-type(3) .testimonial-headline {
  color: var(--Very-dark-grayish-blue);
  padding-right: 40px;
}
.card:nth-of-type(5) .testimonial-headline {
  color: var(--Very-dark-grayish-blue);
}
```
CSS Grid:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1;
  margin: 100px 30px 100px 30px;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [:nth-of-type()](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) - The :nth-of-type() CSS pseudo-class matches elements of a given type (tag name), based on their position among a group of siblings.
- [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.
